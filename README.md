1. Introduction:
The ArithmeticParser, implemented as a Python class, serves the purpose of tokenizing and validating arithmetic expressions supplied by users. This report offers an exhaustive analysis of the code's functionality and its underlying implementation.

2. Overview of the Code:
Comprising a single class named ArithmeticParser, the code houses methods responsible for various operations including tokenizing, validating, and parsing arithmetic expressions.

3. Class Structure:

3.1. Initialization:
In the constructor __init__, the ArithmeticParser object is initialized. This initialization involves compiling a regular expression pattern using the re.compile method, which is essential for tokenizing arithmetic expressions.

3.2. Tokenization:
The tokenize method, designed to accept arithmetic expressions as input, performs tokenization based on the precompiled regular expression pattern. It produces a list of tokens representing numbers, arithmetic operators, and parentheses.

3.3. Token Validation:
Token validation is facilitated by the validate_tokens method. This method ensures that each token extracted from the input expression adheres to the permissible characters, which include digits, arithmetic operators, and parentheses. Any detection of an invalid token results in raising a ValueError.

3.4. Input Parsing:
For user-provided arithmetic expressions, the parse_input method prompts input from the user. Subsequently, it tokenizes the input expression using the tokenize method and validates the tokens using validate_tokens. If the tokens are deemed valid, they are printed to the console; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

4. Example Usage:
An instance of the ArithmeticParser class is instantiated, and the parse_input method is invoked to showcase the code's functionality. This allows users to input arithmetic expressions, which are then subjected to tokenization and validation by the ArithmeticParser.

5. Error Handling:
To manage potential issues, error handling mechanisms have been incorporated into the code. In instances where an invalid token is identified during token validation, a ValueError is raised, accompanied by an appropriate error message for the user's reference.


6. Conclusion:
In conclusion, the ArithmeticParser code presents a robust solution for tokenizing and validating arithmetic expressions. It effectively employs regular expressions for pattern matching and demonstrates proficient error handling techniques in Python. With its versatility, the code can be seamlessly integrated into diverse applications necessitating arithmetic expression processing functionality, thereby offering users a dependable tool for arithmetic expression parsing.
